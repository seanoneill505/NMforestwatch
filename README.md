# Welcome to the NMforestwatch development portal!

The purpose of this README file is to describe the workflows and tools in place to make the NMforestwatch portal a reality.  The NMforestwatch portal has the following workflow and technologies in place:


# Javascript//Python interaction with Google Earth Engine API
>Google Earth Engine makes use of Javascript as well as Python for users to interact with the GEE API.  While this repository has javascript code in place for the workflow, the end goal is using the Python API to increase flexibility of use with the GEE API to automate tasks. The two approaches are similar, but the Python based workflow has critical differences to help automation of all tasks.

# Javascript API workflow for Google Earth Engine 
* Data Ingest Via Google Earth Engine (GEE)//Landsat 8 TOA Teir 1 Import to Google Earth Engine 
  **This step is accomplished through importing the imagery from Google Earth engine servers.  Google has a robust catalogue of image collections to choose from, including Landsat (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), MODIS, Sentinel (1,2,3), as well as many products derived from these image collections.
* Image Collections for New Mexico AOI defined 
  * This is accomplished through the ee.Image() function in the Google Earth Engine API.  One of ee.Image() functions is to define polygons and take only imagery intersecting defined polygons.  
* Datarange of image collections (3 month interval) 
* Cloud Masking performed over AOI
* NDVI band calculated and added to image 
* Feature collections defined/ Hosted as Google Fusion Table
* Mean NDVI calculated from individual pixels to perform time scale analysis over vector polygons
* Charts for time series created
* Values of charts exported
* Image collection exported as GeoTiff's


## Once Images are exported, Javascript based Workflow to host site
* Images collected into SpatialLite Database repositories connected to GeoServer
* Database imported into GeoServer
* GeoServer Hosts Web Coverage Service (WCS) for images to be served to web (found @ http://129.24.65.163:8080/geoserver/web)
* Javascript imports images to HTML webpage hosted by GitHub
* User selects pre-processed datasets to see NDVI time series

# Python API workflow for Google Earth Engine
## Docker Implementation
* Creation of a containerized python environment to ease moving the application from host to host/ improved collaboration outcomes

## Python API Workflow
* Automation of Data Ingest Via Google Earth Engine (GEE)//Landsat 8 TOA Teir 1 Import to Google Earth Engine
* Image Collection retrieval
* Date Range definition
* AOI definition
* Cloud Masking over AOI
* NDVI band added
* Feature Collections Vectors imported from Fusion Tables
* Mean NDVI calculated for Polygons
* Charts of the time series created
* Chart values Exported to google storage
* Images exported as PNG to google storage 

## Web Application hosting
* Google Cloud Datalab hosted locally 
* Scripts executed via Ipython (Jupyter notebook)
* Web application lives in the Google Cloud platform's app engine
* need for local backend greatly reduced
