		<div id="title"><h1>My Geography 585L Open Layers Styled Map Page</h1>
		<p>This is the southern San juan Mountain range region in Southern Colorado.  
			I've chosen this region because it is one of my most coveted areas to camp, ski, and bike.  
			My baselayer is Stamen Terrain, so the user can see the topgraphy of the region.  
			The polygons I have placed with styling represent some of my favorite base camps for exploration, Vallecito Reservoir (Orange outline), Rio Grande Reservoir (Red Outline), 
			Williams creek reservoir (Blue outline), Patoro Reservoir (Green outline *note basemap represents portion of lake not filled), and Big Meadows reservoir (outlined in pink).  
			Also in the map are Colorado counties, Colorado highways, railroads, municipalities, and forest roads (Some layers are availble only at specific scale ranges).</p></div>
